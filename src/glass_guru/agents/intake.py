"""Intake: a phone call, turned into a job the engine can price.

The headline feature, and the clearest case for having an agent at all. A caller says
"my front window's smashed, I'm around Tuesday but I'd have to take the morning off" -
and three quite different things need to happen to that sentence.

**Classify.** Which service is this? A model does that well.

**Estimate.** How long will it take, what certifications, what parts? A model does
that *badly*, so it does not: :mod:`glass_guru.domain.catalog` answers from the
service type. A schedule built on an invented duration is wrong in a way no invariant
check can catch, because every arrival time is internally consistent with the fiction.

**Price the promise.** "I'd have to take the morning off" means this slot is expensive
to move. That is the single clearest justification for a model in this pipeline - no
dropdown captures it, and the solver has no way to infer it. But the model only
identifies *which* signal was expressed, from a fixed list. The dollar figure comes
from configuration, because asking a language model to price goodwill produces a
confident number with nothing behind it.

What is missing matters as much as what was captured. A dispatcher mid-call needs
"ask for a callback number" while the customer is still on the line, not a silently
half-filled form discovered later.

SYSTEM = """\
You are helping a dispatcher take a call at a glass-fitting business. Turn what the
caller said into structured details.

Rules:
- Record only what was said. Never infer an address, a phone number, or a time.
- Pick one service type from the catalogue below, or leave it empty if genuinely unclear.
- Do not estimate how long the job will take. That is not your job and the system
  already knows.
- pane_count is how many panes, not how big. "a 6ft glass", "a 3 by 4 pane" and "the
  big window" are all one pane. Six panes means the caller said six. Getting this
  wrong triples the duration and the crew, and the customer is quoted for a day's work
  they did not ask for.
- Put any time preference in numbers as well as words. "Free after 4pm" is
  earliest_hour 16. "Mornings only" is latest_hour 12. "Before we open at nine" is
  latest_hour 9. Set only the end the caller actually gave: "after 4pm" has an
  earliest and no latest; "before nine" has a latest and no earliest. Leave them null
  when the caller did not say - a guessed constraint is worse than none, because it
  silently rules out slots they would have taken.
- commitment_signals: only arrangements the caller actually mentioned making. Quote
  their words. Say nothing if they said nothing. The difference between these matters,
  because they are priced very differently:
    time_off_work      - they are giving up work or leave for this. "I'd have to take
                         the morning off", "I'm booking a day's holiday".
    waiting_in         - they will simply be at home anyway. "I'll be in all day",
                         "I'm around Friday whenever". Much weaker than taking leave.
    arranged_childcare - cover has been booked that would have to be rebooked.
    business_closed    - a business is closing, opening late, or losing trade for us.
    already_rescheduled - we have moved this appointment before.
- urgency is `emergency` only when the property is insecure or someone is unsafe now.
