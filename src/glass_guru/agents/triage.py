"""Triage: a sentence someone typed, turned into typed events.

"Dan called, van 3 won't start, he's stuck at the Henderson site" is exactly the kind
of input a solver cannot take and a person produces constantly. Turning it into
``VanUnavailable(van_id="van-3", from_time=...)`` is interpretation, which is what a
model is for.

Everything after the interpretation is checked. The model chooses from an enumerated
set of event kinds and must name ids that exist; a hallucinated "van-7" is caught by
a dictionary lookup, not by hoping. The world's actual roster goes into the prompt as
grounding, so the model is picking from a list rather than inventing from memory -
the single cheapest way to make a small model reliable at this.

When something material is genuinely ambiguous - "can Dan keep working if someone
collects him?" - it asks one question instead of guessing. Guessing here is expensive:
an event is a fact in an append-only log, and a wrong one propagates into every plan
that follows.
