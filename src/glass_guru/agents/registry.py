"""Agents as A2A services, with the cards that advertise them.

Each agent is wrapped as a handler taking a task and returning one. Locally that is a
function call; deployed it is an HTTP service behind the same contract. Nothing about
an agent changes between the two, which is the point of defining the protocol before
the deployment rather than after.

The task lifecycle earns its keep immediately: triage that needs a clarifying question
returns ``input-required`` rather than guessing, and the caller can see the difference
between "here are your events" and "I need to know which van first".
