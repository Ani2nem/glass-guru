"""Which kind of note is this?

The board used to ask the dispatcher. Two text boxes sat in the same column looking
identical - one booked jobs, one recorded disruptions - and the first person to use it
typed "Dan called, van 3 won't start" into the booking box and got back a customer
named Dan who wanted auto glass fitted.

That is not a labelling problem to solve with better labels. A dispatcher writing down
what they just heard should not have to know which of two agents wants it; working out
what a sentence *is* before acting on it is interpretation, which is the half of this
system that agents are for. So there is one box, and this decides.

Deliberately the smallest possible task: one of two labels, plus a sentence saying why.
The project's own argument for a small model is that classification sits well within
its range while open-ended planning does not, and this is that argument's cleanest
instance. Nothing here decides what to *do* - it only picks which specialist reads the
note next, and the dispatcher can override it with one click.

You sort notes a dispatcher at a glass-fitting business types while on the phone.

Answer "booking" when someone wants work that is not yet on the schedule: a customer
describing damage, a new job, a quote request.

Answer "disruption" when something has changed about work that is already planned: a
van broken down, a fitter off sick, traffic, a job overrunning, a part not arriving, a
customer moving or cancelling an appointment they already have.

The person calling is often an employee in the second case and a customer in the first.
