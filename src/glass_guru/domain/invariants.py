"""Independent verification that a plan is actually feasible.

This module is deliberately written *without* reference to how the solver works. It
re-derives every checkable fact from the plan, the world state, and a travel oracle.
If the solver and this checker ever disagree, the checker wins and the plan is
rejected - that is the entire point. A small language model in the loop makes this
more important, not less: agents propose, deterministic code disposes.

``validate_plan`` is a runtime guard, not a test. Nothing reaches the database
without passing it.

Window semantics, which are easy to get wrong:

* A **hard** window means the service must *start and finish* inside it. "Must be
  done before we open at 09:00" is not satisfied by starting at 08:55.
* A **soft** window constrains the start only. Finishing late is priced by the
  objective as a lateness penalty, not treated as infeasible.
* Under either kind, service may not *begin* before the window opens - nobody is
  there to let the crew in.
