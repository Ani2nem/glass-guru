"""Repairing a committed plan after something goes wrong.

A disruption is not a re-planning problem. Most of the day is still fine, crews are
already out, and customers have been told things. Re-solving from scratch would be
correct and useless: it would produce a better schedule that breaks every promise in
it.

So repair is optimisation with three extra facts the morning solve does not have:

* **Work already in flight is physically fixed.** A crew on site cannot be moved by
  an optimiser.
* **A promise costs money to break.** ``commitment_cost`` - the numeric weight behind
  "I'll take off work that day" - is what the model spends when it must release one.
  That field exists precisely so this decision is priced rather than arbitrary.
* **Change itself has a cost.** Even moving provisional work churns routes that crews
  have already looked at, so a plan that changes three things beats an equivalent one
  that changes thirty.

Repair returns several labelled candidates rather than one answer, because choosing
between "keep every promise and serve less" and "serve more and make two phone calls"
is a judgement about this business on this day. The solver prices the options; a human
or the coordinator agent picks.
