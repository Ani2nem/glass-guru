"""Turning a *sequence* of jobs into a concrete route with real clock times.

The solver decides which jobs a crew does and in what order. This module decides
what that costs in wall-clock terms: when the van leaves, how long each drive takes
at the time of day it actually happens, and when the crew gets home.

Keeping it separate matters because the solver optimizes over an approximation
(integer minutes, a snapshot matrix) while this replays the sequence against the
travel oracle at the real departure time of every leg. Anything the approximation
got wrong shows up here as a later arrival, and then the invariant checker catches
it. Solver, materializer, and checker are three independent views of the same plan.

    A crew that would reach a customer before their window opens does not idle on the

    on *departure* time, so pricing a leg at the moment the crew became free while the
    schedule implies they left forty minutes later produces a stored travel time that
    no longer matches the road. The invariant checker recomputes each leg from
    ``arrival - travel_minutes``, and correctly rejects the mismatch.

    So the departure is solved as a fixed point: leave at ``target - travel(departure)``,
    re-evaluating travel at that departure until it settles. Traffic buckets are coarse,
