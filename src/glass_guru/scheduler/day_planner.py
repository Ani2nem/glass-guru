"""Single-day crew formation, van assignment, and routing, as one CP-SAT model.

Why these are solved together rather than in stages: assignment quality depends on
travel cost, and travel cost depends on assignment. Clustering jobs geographically
and then routing each cluster locks in bad assignments before knowing what they cost.

Why CP-SAT rather than the OR-Tools routing library: full depth here means a crew is
*one or two workers plus a van*, chosen per day. Pre-enumerating crews for six workers
and four vans gives ~84 candidate "vehicles" with no native way to say each worker and
each van is used at most once. Expressed directly in CP-SAT, that is two lines.

Crews are indexed by van - "crew k" just means "the team using van k" - which fixes
the van-assignment decision by construction and removes a large symmetry group.

Two deliberate approximations, both made safe downstream:

1. **One travel matrix per solve**, not a time-dependent one. CP-SAT cannot cheaply
   express "this leg costs more because you drive it at 16:45". The matrix is built
   *pessimistically* (worst traffic bucket the shift can span), so real travel is at
   worst as long as planned; a route that materializes faster only ever arrives early
   and waits. Optimistic matrices would do the opposite and silently break hard windows.
2. **A blended labour rate** in the objective, rather than each crew's exact mix.
   The objective only has to *rank* routes. Once a route is materialized, its true
   dollar cost is computed exactly by :mod:`glass_guru.scheduler.costing`.

The output is a sequence, not a schedule. Concrete times come from
:func:`~glass_guru.scheduler.routing.materialize_route`, and are then checked
independently by :mod:`glass_guru.domain.invariants`.

    # ------------------------------------------------------- breaking exact ties
    #
    # Two plans can cost exactly the same and put different people in different vans.
    # That is not symmetry - Sofia and Alex hold different certifications and are paid
    # differently - it is degeneracy, and the blended labour rate this model uses by
    # design is part of what creates it: the objective deliberately cannot see the
    # difference between a $57 tech and a $52 one, so on a day where both are qualified
    # it has no reason to prefer either.
    #
    # Left alone, the answer is whichever the search reached first, which is a property
    # of the machine rather than the problem. The same OR-Tools version, the same seed,
    # one search worker and a deterministic budget all failed to fix it: both answers
    # were OPTIMAL and cost $405.61 to the cent. It surfaced as golden board snapshots
    # passing on arm64 and failing on x86_64.
    #
    # So the tie is broken here instead, lexicographically: among plans of equal cost,
    # prefer the one that puts earlier-named workers on earlier vans. Scaling the real
    # objective above the largest possible tie-break value makes this exact rather than
    # approximate - no tie-break can ever outweigh a single cent of real cost.
