"""Exact dollar cost of a materialized plan.

Distinct from the solver's objective on purpose. CP-SAT optimizes an approximation -
one pessimistic travel matrix, integer minutes, a blended labour rate - because that
is what keeps the model linear and fast. This module prices the plan that actually
came out, leg by leg, at the times those legs really happen.

The gap between the two is diagnostic rather than embarrassing: a large divergence
means the approximation is drifting from reality and the matrix or the bucket choice
needs attention. The CLI prints both side by side for exactly that reason.
