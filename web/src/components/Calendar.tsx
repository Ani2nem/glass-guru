 * taste. Laid out horizontally, a forty-five minute job is a forty-five pixel sliver
 * and "Rodriguez Storefront" cannot be written in it at any font size. I tried
 * scrolling the text on hover, which was worse: motion to read something that should
 * simply have been legible.
 *
 * Turned on its side the same job is a block forty-five pixels *tall* and the full
 * width of a day column, which is room for the customer, the time and the crew
 * without truncating any of them. The constraint was never the amount of text.
 *
 * Overlapping work inside one day splits the column, the way every calendar does it -
 * so two crews out at the same time sit side by side rather than on top of each other.
