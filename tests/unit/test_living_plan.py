"""Diff classification, autonomy, repair and persistence.

The load-bearing assertion here is about *blast radius*. A promise is a window, not a
minute, so a crew arriving at 12:40 instead of 09:33 inside a 09:00-15:00 window has
not let anyone down. Getting that wrong in either direction breaks the product: nag
about nothing and the dispatcher stops reading the queue; stay quiet too often and
the system moves an appointment somebody booked a day off work for.
